This app will dispaly the details of a train--name, destination, frequency of trains, the next arrival, and the time from now until the next arrival.  There is initial data that is being pulled from the database to populate the table on the first loading of the app.  The user can then enter train data into the form and the data will be stored in Firebase and the next arrival and time from now until the next arrival are calculated then populated into the table.
